machine learning project


**Overview**
This project aims to create a web application that predicts house prices in Bengaluru using a machine learning model. The project uses OpenCV for data processing, a machine learning model for prediction, Flask for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

**Features**
User Input: Users can input various features of the house (e.g., location, size, number of bedrooms, etc.).
Price Prediction: The input data is processed and the house price is predicted using the machine learning model.
Result Display: The predicted price is displayed on the frontend.

**Technologies Used**
Machine Learning: Python, OpenCV, Scikit-Learn
Backend: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Setup and Installation**
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Flask
OpenCV
Scikit-Learn
HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

**Usage**
Open the web application in your browser.
Input the required features of the house (e.g., location, size, number of bedrooms, etc.).
Click the "Predict" button.
View the predicted house price.

Project Details**
Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model is responsible for predicting house prices based on input features. It is built using OpenCV for data processing and a machine learning framework like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or Keras for building and training the model. The trained model is saved as model.pkl.

Backend (Flask)
The backend is built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework. The Flask app handles user inputs, processes the data using the machine learning model, and returns the predicted price to the frontend.

Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting house features and displaying the predicted price.
